								<p class="tm-mb-p">Greenhouse gases are increasing at an alarming rate, and one of the most significant factors is the carbon emission from vehicles or factories. Hence Evergarden Online Website was founded in the early 2020s when the pandemic was at its peak, and everybody was staying home and having more free time than they usually had, which was the perfect opportunity to advocate for everybody to go green. Since everybody was at home, lesser and lesser customers visited the physical store of Evergarden forcing us to take action and make an Online Market Website so we are allowed to connect to our customers. Evergarden goal was to support the reduction of our carbon footprints by vending gardening accessories/kits and plants/seeds to encourage everyone to green and nurse some plants for homemade produce or decoration. </p>
